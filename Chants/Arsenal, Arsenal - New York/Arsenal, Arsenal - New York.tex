		Start spreading the news, \\
		We're playing today, \\
		We'll always be a part of it - Arsenal, Arsenal, \\
		These red and white shoes, are longing to stray, \\
		Right through the very heart of it - through Arsenal, \\
		We always wake up in an Arsenal wonderland, \\
		And find we're king of the hill, top of the heap, \\ 
		A number one! \\
		These second-rate teams, are melting away, \\
		They just ain't got the heart for it, at Arsenal, \\
		If we can win it there, we'll win it anywhere$\ldots$
