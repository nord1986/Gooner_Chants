		Sing about the Gunners, \\
		We're the lads in Red and White, \\
		We can play the football game, \\
		And we can play it right. \\
		While there's still a minute left, \\
		We'll not give up the fight, \\
		When we go marching on Wembley.\par 
		March on, march on! \\
		The boys from Highbury. \\
		March on, march on! \\
		March on to victory.\par
		The Gunners colours on the Cup, \\
		Is what we're gonna see, \\
		When we go marching on Wembley!
